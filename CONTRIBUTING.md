       "name": "Top Portugal NewService Movies",
       "description": "List that contains the top 10 movies on NewService Portugal right now, updated daily",
       "privacy": "public",
       "display_numbers": True
   }
   ```

3. **Add to Main Processing Loop**
   ```python
   # In main() function
   top_newservice_movies = scrape_top10(top_newservice_url, top_movies_section)
   ```

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Add the new service to README.md
   - Update feature lists and examples
